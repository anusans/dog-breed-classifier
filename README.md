# Dog Breed Classifier

## Overview
I built a convolutional neural network from scratch that determines if a given picture of a dog to classify its breed. I built another convolutional neural network and used transfer learning to achieve better accuracy and genealization. To train the neural network, I used a public dataset.

## Requirements
* Python 3 environment (`pyenv` recommended)

## Usage
1. Run `pip install requirements.txt` to install all packages.
1. Open `dog_breed_classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or equivalent and execute the cells to train and run the neural net.
